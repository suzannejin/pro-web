                    <h1>Can we grow more from less?</h1>
                    <p>The earth under our feet is too often ignored - and yet there can be no life without it.</p>
                    <p>Healthy soils are essential for our food security: 95% of our food comes from the earth. It is also the planet&apos;s largest natural water filter, helping supply the world with clean water. Soil even helps regulate the climate - storing more carbon than all the world&apos;s forests put together.</p>
                    <p>Soils are also one of the most active ecosystems on earth. A handful of soil contains more organisms and micro-organisms than the planet&apos;s entire human population. Worldwide soils encompass one quarter of the planet&apos;s biodiversity, including billions of microbes that are the foundation of today&apos;s antibiotics</p>
                    <p>In short, soil is integral to keeping the world healthy. But healthy soil is being lost at a worrying rate - soil fertility is declining, and soil erosion and land overdevelopment is seeing us lose potentially productive land forever.</p>
