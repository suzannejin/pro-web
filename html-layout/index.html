                    <p>One of the most memorable moments of Steven Spielberg’s 1993 dinosaur blockbuster Jurassic Park is the tense dinner table conversation between the assembled scientists on the ethics of the park’s use of genetic engineering. Match point is scored by Jeff Goldblum’s chaos theorist Ian Malcolm:</p>
                    <p id='p2'>“Genetic power is the most awesome force the planet has ever seen, but you wield it like a kid that’s found his dad’s gun… your scientists were so preoccupied about whether or not they could, they didn’t stop to think if they should.”</p>
                    <p>That was 1993. Genetic science has moved on a lot since then. In 1996, Dolly the Sheep became the first fully cloned animal. And in 2003, the human genome was finally fully sequenced.<br><br>
                        November 2017 saw the latest milestone in our increasingly intimate and complex relationship with our genes, when 44-year-old Californian Brian Madeux was injected with copies of a corrective gene in an attempt to cure his Hunter’s Disease. The injection was intended to directly edit Madeux’s gene code, removing faulty pieces of the genome and stitch it back together.<br><br>
                        If successful, this treatment will be a major step forward for the medical application of gene-editing technology. But are we opening a Pandora’s box? Now that we can, do we need to stop and ask whether or not we should?</p>
